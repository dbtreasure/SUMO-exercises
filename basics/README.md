### CartPole

Classic control problem: balance a pole on a moving cart.

Two agent implementations:
- **Tabular Q-Learning**: Discretizes continuous state space into bins, uses Q-table
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: Neural network approximates Q-values, handles continuous states natively

See [cartpole/README.md](cartpole/README.md) for details.
